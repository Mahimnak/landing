To run the above project follow the steps given below:
1. Clone the project into your personal computer using the URL provided by GitHub(for example https://github.com/Mahimnak/landing.git)
2. Go to the directory where you have cloned the file, and open it in your preferred IDE(vs code would be best).
3. Run a terminal in the directory and type the command - **npm install**. This will install all the required dependencies.
4. You can now run the command - **npm run start** and this should start the application on the localhost server.
5. If you face any issues, check whether Tailwind is correctly installed or not, you have  node.js present in your machine and npm is present.
6. A screenshot of the web page created by me is attached below incase the project doesn't run on your machine.
